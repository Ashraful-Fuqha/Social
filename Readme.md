## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Social. is built with a powerful combination of modern technologies, ensuring performance, scalability, and a great developer experience.

### Frontend

  * **React:** The core JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
  * **TypeScript:** Provides static type-checking, enhancing code quality, readability, and maintainability.
  * **React Router DOM:** For declarative routing within the single-page application.
  * **Zustand:** A fast, lightweight, and scalable state management solution for React, used for global client-side state.
  * **React Query (TanStack Query):** An essential library for managing, caching, and synchronizing server-state in React, providing automatic refetching, background updates, and optimistic UI.
  * **Shadcn UI:** A collection of beautifully designed, re-usable UI components (built on Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS) for a consistent and accessible design system.
  * **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development and highly customized designs.
  * **Sonner:** An elegant and accessible toast library for displaying notifications and user feedback.

### Backend

  * **Node.js:** The JavaScript runtime environment powering the server-side logic.
  * **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, forming the RESTful API layer.
  * **MongoDB:** A flexible, scalable NoSQL document database used for persistent data storage.
  * **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, simplifying interactions with the database through schemas.
  * **Clerk (Authentication):** Integrated for robust authentication, handling user sign-up, sign-in, and session management securely. Its webhooks keep user data synchronized.
  * **Cloudinary:** A cloud-based media management platform used for efficient storage, optimization, and delivery of video assets, thumbnails, and user avatars.
  * **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Used for secure, stateless API authentication.
  * **bcryptjs:** For hashing user passwords to ensure robust security.
  * **Other Essential Libraries:** `cors`, `cookie-parser`, `dotenv`, `multer` (for file uploads), `express-async-handler` (for simplified error handling), `zod` (for schema validation).

## ðŸš§ Struggles and Challenges

Building a full-stack application with a rich feature set in a limited timeframe presented several exciting challenges:

  * **Complex Clerk Integration:** While Clerk simplifies authentication, integrating its robust features (like webhooks for user data synchronization with the backend and handling session management across different API calls) required a deep understanding of its lifecycle and careful backend implementation.
  * **Efficient State Management:** Managing user-specific data (likes, subscriptions, watch history, playlists) across various components and ensuring a reactive UI required a thoughtful approach using Zustand for global state and React Query for server-side data synchronization. Preventing stale data and unnecessary re-renders was a continuous refinement process.
  * **Frontend-Backend API Design:** Designing a clear, consistent, and secure RESTful API for all functionalities, including complex relationships (e.g., videos and their owners, comments, likes), was crucial. This involved meticulous planning of routes, request/response structures, and error handling.
  * **Cloudinary Media Handling:** Implementing robust video and image upload, processing (e.g., thumbnail generation), and efficient delivery using Cloudinary's API posed unique challenges in file handling and ensuring optimal media performance.
  * **Database Schema Optimization:** Crafting efficient MongoDB schemas and choosing appropriate indexing strategies for fast queries, especially for features like watch history (which required specific ordering and population), was key to performance.
  * **Rapid Iteration & Problem Solving:** The tight **20-day deadline** necessitated quick decision-making, rapid prototyping, and efficient debugging. Each new feature brought its own set of unique technical hurdles that had to be overcome swiftly.
  * **Minimal AI Dependence:** Relying predominantly on documentation, official guides, and conventional problem-solving (Stack Overflow, debugging) rather than heavy AI prompting for complex architectural decisions fostered a deeper understanding of each technology.
